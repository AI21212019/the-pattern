# the-pattern
Overall repository for NLP pipeline, API and UI, design and architecture

# Why The Pattern name
The name is from [Roger Zelazny "The Chronicles of Amber"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Amber#The_Pattern_and_the_Logrus) where The Pattern is the foundation of the universe of order. 
I believe in the modern world we need new tools to fight the chaos of the information, particularly for such important issues as medical research and literature.
